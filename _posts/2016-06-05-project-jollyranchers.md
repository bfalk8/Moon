# CSE 125 - 'the video game class'

This class served as a capstone project of sorts for the ambitious CSE majors at UCSD. Professor Voelker has been offering the class every Spring quarter since 2001 and hopefully for many years to come. 

The class has only one grading criteria, **the project.** The specifications for the project are that your team must design and develop a fully networked, 3D, multiplayer video game that runs on the Windows32 platform. The team size is around 7 people per group and able to be structured however the team feels is most practical for their workflow. Though the specs are of the more relaxed nature, the project remains grueling until the end as the team and I spent every bit of free time working on the project throughout the quarter. This relaxed set of specifications also lead to some very unique games being produced, and I feel this gives the class its charm.

I was responsible for all the networking concerns and built a messaging protocol on top of the Windows TCP sockets library `winsock`. I also built a map editor harnessing the power of the `Tiled` tile map editor.
